HardGrind No-OP is a singleplayer discipline mod for Fabric 1.21.9.
It removes every shortcut that could ruin your grind — no /op, no /gamemode, no cheating.
Even in singleplayer, you play by the same rules as on a real public survival server.

Main Features

OP is dead: All operator permission checks always return false.

Command lockdown: Blocks /op, /deop, /gamemode, /give, /tp, /summon, /effect, /xp, /enchant, /locate, and /gamerule.

Permanent survival: Automatically switches players back to Survival mode every tick if they somehow escape.

Lightweight: No configuration, no UI, no nonsense — just a strict singleplayer survival environment.

Intended Use
For players who want the real grind experience in singleplayer — no temptation, no exceptions.
Perfect for those training for multiplayer servers or challenge worlds.
